## Setting Up Your Local Environment

Follow these steps to set up your local environment for the Natours app:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alin00r/natours.git
   cd Task-Manager-API
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Before you can run the Natours app, you need to set up your environment variables. These variables store sensitive information required for the app to function properly. Follow these steps to configure your environment variables:

   1. **Create a `.env` File:**
      In the root directory of the app, create a file named `.env`.

   2. **Add the Following Environment Variables:**
      Replace the placeholders with your actual information. You might need to sign up for accounts and services to obtain the required credentials.

      ```dotenv

      # MongoDB Configuration
      MONGO_URI_ATLAS=your-mongodb-database-url

      # JSON Web Token Configuration
      JWT_SECRET=your-json-web-token-secret

# API reference

During API development, I use `Postman` for handling/testing all endpoints.

- Base URL endpoints: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` or `http://localhost:3000/`
